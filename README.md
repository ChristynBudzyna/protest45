#Protest45
The results of the 2016 Election are in, and Donald Trump is the president-elect of the United States. It is our right as Americans to protest the platform that he campaigned on and voice our opinion as publically as possible. The best way to do so is to get out there and organize events together. However, doing so can be challenging-there are so many platforms spread around the internet.

Protest45 aims to provide a central hub for creating and organizing these protests. With this app, you will be able to host and attend protest events in one of the major US cities that the app currently supports. 

##Features
- Login with Devise or Facebook OAuth
- A list of major cities-currently New York, San Fransisco, Chicago, Boston, DC, and Los Angeles-and their associated events, which will only appear when approved by site admins.
- Filtering events by a list of pre-populated tags.
- Event creation, as well as the ability to edit and delete events restricted to site admins and the event's creator.
- Links to specific event details as well as a link to the specific Facebook event.
- Links to external protest resources and organizations you can donate to.

##Coming Soon
- Support for more major US cities.
- A robust search feature to find local events.
- Google Maps integration.
